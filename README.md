Introducing "Drishtikon": An OpenInsight Bangla News Aggregator
------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm excited to share a project I've been conceptualizing: a Bangla news aggregator named "Drishtikon" (meaning "Perspective"). This platform aims to summarize news and detect bias (similar to Ground News) and partiality across at least 200 prominent newspapers and YouTube channels.


The Challenge
---------------
One of the biggest hurdles we face is obtaining Bangla transcripts from video news sources. To overcome this, we're incorporating cutting-edge Bangla Speech-to-Text technology.

The Process
--------------
Our approach involves four key steps:
a) Video Acquisition:
Use youtube-dl to download Bangla YouTube videos from prominent channels like Jamuna TV.

b) Audio Extraction:
Extract the sound/speech from the downloaded videos.

c) Speech-to-Text Conversion:
Convert the extracted audio to text transcriptions using advanced Bangla Speech-to-Text recognition models (e.g., https://lnkd.in/gdm64NEF by Saiful Islam and others).

d) News Extraction and Processing:
Process the Bangla text to extract and summarize the most recent news items.

Our Vision
-----------
Drishtikon aims to provide comprehensive insights across various crucial areas:
 * Crime Rate Analysis
 * Political Developments
 * Economic Indicators
 * Health and Safety Updates
 * Educational Reforms
 * Environmental Issues
 * Public Opinion Trends
 * Infrastructure Development
 * Social Justice Matters
 * Entertainment and Cultural Highlights

By amalgamating these diverse perspectives, Drishtikon seeks to offer a holistic view of current events in Bangladesh, empowering readers with balanced and insightful news coverage.
